# ðŸ’¯ 100 Days of Dart Coding Challenge ðŸš€

Welcome to my journey through the #100DaysOfCode challenge, focused on mastering the Dart programming language! This repository documents my progress, daily learnings, and the projects I build along the way.

## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Code is a popular self-improvement challenge where participants commit to coding for at least one hour every day for 100 consecutive days. My focus for this challenge is to deepen my understanding of Dart, explore its various capabilities (including Flutter development, server-side with Aqueduct/Shelf, and command-line tools), and build practical projects.

## My Goals

* **Solidify Dart Fundamentals:** Gain a strong grasp of Dart's syntax, data structures, control flow, and object-oriented programming concepts.
* **Explore Flutter Framework:** Dive into mobile, web, and desktop development using Flutter, building engaging and performant applications.
* **Experiment with Server-Side Dart:** Investigate server-side development using frameworks like Aqueduct or Shelf for building APIs and backends.
* **Develop Practical Projects:** Create a portfolio of projects that showcase my Dart skills and problem-solving abilities.
* **Consistent Learning:** Establish a daily coding habit and continuously learn new aspects of the Dart ecosystem.
* **Engage with the Community:** Share my progress, learn from others, and contribute to the Dart and Flutter communities.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by day, with each day's progress potentially including:

* **`day_XX/`:** A folder for each day of the challenge (e.g., `day_01/`, `day_15/`, `day_100/`).
* **`day_XX/README.md`:** A brief markdown file within each day's folder summarizing what I learned and worked on that day.
* **`day_XX/code/`:** A directory containing the code written for that day's exercises or projects.
* **`projects/`:** A folder to house larger projects developed during the challenge.
* **`resources/`:** A directory for useful links, articles, or documentation I find helpful.

## Progress

You can follow my daily progress in the respective `day_XX/README.md` files. I'll be documenting:

* Topics learned
* Code snippets and examples
* Challenges faced and solutions found
* Links to relevant resources

**Current Status:** [Update with your current day, e.g., Day 10, Day 55, Completed!]

## Projects

Throughout this challenge, I'll be working on various projects to apply my learning. Details and code for these projects will be available in the `projects/` directory. Stay tuned for exciting creations!

## How to Follow Along

* **Star this repository:** To keep track of my progress.
* **Check the daily folders:** For updates on what I'm learning each day.
* **Follow me on https://x.com/owoo_bernard:** Where I'll be sharing daily updates and insights using the #100DaysOfCode and #Dart hashtags.
* **Feel free to contribute (constructively):** If you have suggestions, find errors, or want to share helpful resources, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
